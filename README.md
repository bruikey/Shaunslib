<strong>Description: </strong>This is User Database Testing App is a simple application designed to test user registration and login feature. It uses Flask framework along with Nginx as reverse proxy and uWSGI as web server. The app is designed to connect with a PostgreSQL database, but could be configured to other databases with few changes allowing users to sign up and log in.

<strong>Configure PostgreSQL:</strong> Set up a PostgreSQL server on your chosen environment (cloud, instance, local).

<strong>URI Configuration: </strong>Edit the app.py to config. URI or URL to your DB.

<strong>Note:</strong> This app is designed for testing purposes and does not include the PostgreSQL or any Database server though everything is configured apart from URI obviously. Users are responsible for setting up their own Database server. It is tested and works! :')
